# @micyo - tiny libraries

I have prepared the relevant repository to share the tools and libraries that I frequently use in projects as open source. This way, I can easily use them in my future projects. We can also collaborate to further enhance the project together.

## Libraries

- [@micyo/react-forms](https://github.com/ThemeSama/micyo/tree/main/packages/react-forms/README.md) | Basic unstyled form elements for React projects
- [@micyo/react-can](https://github.com/ThemeSama/micyo/tree/main/packages/react-can/README.md) | Simple authorisation library for React projects
- @micyo/react-settings | Apply the global project settings of client's crosstabs.
