# useSettings

The WordPress REST API Settings endpoint provides access to site-wide settings, allowing developers to retrieve and update various configurable options for a WordPress site. This includes general settings such as site title, description, URL, time zone, date format, and more. With proper authentication, this endpoint enables programmatic management of settings, making it a powerful tool for integrations and automations that need to dynamically configure site preferences.
