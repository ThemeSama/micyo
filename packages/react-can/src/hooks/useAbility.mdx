# useAbility

You can use the useAbility hook to add new permissions to the user, remove some of the existing permissions, or remove all permissions altogether from within the page. You can perform permission control at the JavaScript level using the can method. Additionally, you can perform boolean checks at the prop level using the can method in JSX content.
